# Pitica
A bit of a context to what this game will be. I have a friend who does animation at FAAP (Fundação Armando Alvarez Penteado), and on the middle of the Summer of 2023, they made a stop-motion animation to
which they called "Pitica". I found the concept really interesting as it talks about a little monster on a red hood that goes out on a post-apocalyptic Earth to find an ingredient from a culinary book they
have. With that, I talked to this friend and since late July 2023 we have been thinking about making this story an open world videogame where Pitica, the main character, goes around exploring the world
and looking for specific items on their adventure book in order to fulfill their grandma's wish to complete the book. They will find diverse enemies that were infected by the radiation of the last great
war, and we believe it is a game with great potential.

So far, I only had time to test some movement, but I will add much more this next semester (Spring of 2024) as I will be studying video games in Denmark!
